# Touchscreen RGB LED Strip 

Description: An individually addressable RGB LED Strip (WS2811) was controlled using an Arduino Uno with the FastLED library. A touchscreen was connected to the Arduino board using a breakout board, allowing the user to interact with the LED strip. The touchscreen was used to change the settings of the LED strips (color, brightness, and effect). Customizations and multiple effects for the LED Strip are listed below.
